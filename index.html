        10th edition has launch but it is missing a LOT of Datasheets. If youre as annoyed as me, make your own here!<br>

    Oh well, ended up in support again! Everything apart from easy hobbies on freeze now probably until the mortgage is paid. That's life.<br>

    There's nothing like some time off to give you perspective. I've realised how many hobbies and interests I need to shelve if I ever want to make progress with the others. From 
    now on its going to be piano and writing exclusively. That's it! I've enjoyed dabbling in web but in all honesty work has just about killed my love of computing dead now. I also realised
    that I'll never get to where I want to be as a guitar player or painter. Maybe if I did those things in isolation but also maybe not. Better to achieve the things I really want and need
    to achieve.<br>

    Created my new hobby blog - Grimblog. There's a link up above. A place to show of my minis, army lists and battle reports for Warhammer 40K.<br>

    Added the new list making app Lister. It uses local storage and is serverless. You will lose your data if you clear your browser cache but there's a backup/restore option.
    Still a bit to do but it is mostly there.<br>

    Added the new grimdark section to hold my army lists and associated hobby stuff for WH40K.<br>

    If you speak a second language you have to stay on top of your grammar. I've reworked an old app "conjug" to brush up on my French! It's in the apps section above.<br>

    Updated functionality of the chord designer tool above:<br>
    It now graphs your chord on the stave and has the beginnings of an analysis suite.<br>

    Started work getting my guitar blog in shape here at github:<br>

    As a stimulus for writing I asked Reddit and some other contacts to answer some short questions on happiness. Here are the results:<br>
    <a href="survey/responses.pdf">responses</a><br>
    <a href="survey/unhappiness.png">causes of unhappiness</a><br>
    <a href="survey/happiness.png">sources of happiness</a><br>
