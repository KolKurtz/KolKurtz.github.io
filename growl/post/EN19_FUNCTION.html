	     A MUSICAL FUNCTION PRIMER
		</div>

    <div id="postContent">
      <p>

Function is an immense subject. Not only does it underpin a lot of composition and
appreciation of music, but it also asks questions about what role we have as musicians.
This article is intended as a jumping off point for further study because really
your role will determine what in function matters to you. I'd warn NEVER to use my
less technical articles (like this one) as a source. My definitions for things often
don't agree with the established ones. That doesn't stop me thinking mine are right! At
least they are for me.

  </p>

  <p>
*Follow red links to dive into technical subjects. I wrote this overview first so
beware you might need to come back to see all of them finished. ;)
</p>

<p>
A LOOSE DESCRIPTION
</p>

<p>
Function is, VERY loosely, how and why music works. I mean music in the scale of
whole pieces down to complete phrases. Function differs from tonality because the
latter determines <a href="EN9_KEYS_MODES_BISCUITS.html">what notes belong in a scale</a>, how those chords are formed and what
melody notes accord with them. Tonality I'd say, works at the phrase level and below.
So maybe we better discuss tonality...
</p>

<p>
WHAT IS TONALITY!?
</p>

<p>
Tonality is the whole raft of expectations, idioms, "rules" and practices that form
an identifiable system of music. The most obvious example of such a system is Western
tonality (as in the Western world). Music in the west grew up out of the major and minor
scale. By virtue of those we know what notes, chords and thus progressions we are
likely to hear in music. Further, because we are so used to hearing them, we have
widely come to prefer certain patterns within that system. Not without reason are most
pop songs written around the 1, 4 and 5 chord of the major scale - they are fulfilling
expectations.
</p>

<p>
Tonalities are not set however. Western music in the last century has evolved, and
although niche, traditional laws and tastes are highly eroded in some areas. Suffice it to
say though, hundreds of years of repeated practices have established a working system.
</p>

<p>
By way of example; our western tonality tends to suggest that a C (CEGB) major chord
played in accompaniment is unlikely to underpin a completely chromatic (all the
tones C,C#,D,D#...) melody. It is yet more unlikely to go with a melody in the key
of C# major (C#,D#,E#,F#,G#,A#,B#). Those melody notes don't belong in the C major scale.
Tonality in the form of our expectations AND our practices means there are things we
do and don't do. These aren't rules, they are just things we've gotten used to.
</p>

<p>
HOW DOES FUNCTION MAKE MUSIC WORK?
</p>

<p>
To re-enforce what we expect from a tonality, function acts to clarify things like
key and structure. The main way it accomplishes this is by establishing harmony through
consonance and dissonance and indicating which note is tonic (home).
</p>

<p>
Consonance and dissonance exist as a continuum. They sit as extremes at either end
of a sliding scale. Not only will musicians argue from a theory standpoint about what
is dissonant, but the everyday listener will do it too. When you hear live musicians
emit a bum note you just experienced a dissonance. That note did NOT fit with the
underlying chords and bass and someone is about to get fired. That's an extreme example,
we even find dissonance WITHIN musical scales.
</p>

<p>
Try playing a major 7 chord, for example <a href="EN18_SEVENCHORDS.html">Cmajor7 (CEGB)</a>.
It is a nice nostalgic chord, right? Mostly, yes, but play just the C and the B alone. That is NOT so nice. If you play
the B one note lower than the C, it is even worse. How can this be? Surely we're in key,
all the notes are "right". What you are experiencing is a dissonant <a href="EN12_NUMERICNOTATION.html">interval</a> within they key.
The worst of all, an absolute howler, is the diminished 5th. Every major scale spells
out a dominant 7th chord from its 5th note. In C major, for example, this is G7 (eg: GFBD). If
you play that chord, it is bluesy, almost jovial. However, if you play just the 3 and 7 of
the chord (as B-F or F-B), woah! Dissonance produces tension.
</p>

<p>
Tension can be reduced in music by "resolution". Just as we build tensions by adding
dissonant intervals, by following those intervals with consonant intervals that tension is
reduced. Most often this is accomplished by taking the tones making up a dissonant interval and
either separating them or moving them closer together so that they are no longer dissonant. In
our G7 example above, we could resolve that diminished 5th interval by following the G7chord (GFBD)
with (CEGC) Cmajor. F-B is now E-G and we have replaced the diminished 5th with a far mor consonant minor third.
This is a gross simplification of something called <a href="EN21_VOICELEADING101.html">"voice leading"</a>, keeping track of the component voices
inside harmonic blocks like chords. Again, it is a vast subject and a cornerstone of composition.
</p>

<p>
Something else has happened in our example of G7 to CMajor. If you play the two chords
in sequence you can't help notice the feeling of arriving home. Whilst the dissonance
resolving has something to do with it, the movement of G to C in the lowest notes of the
chord is VERY pleasing. In western tonal harmony, the descent of a fifth is the strongest
bass movement possible. This is an example of a musical <a href="EN20_CADENCE101.html">"cadence"</a>. Powerful, complete sounding
changes in harmony like this serve as the punctuation points in music. They can be used to
end phrases, re-iterate where "home" is and even inform the listener that we are at a new "home".
In our G7 to CM example we would actually say that the G7 chord "functioned" as a dominant. As
composers we have deliberately used a chord that states the end of a musical unit by returning home.
</p>

<p>
HARNESSING THE TENSION
</p>

<p>
Whilst it is possible to write a song where the goal is to minimize dissonance as much as
possible, I would argue that it isn't much of a song. Without a doubt, a person's preferences
are a question of taste, but arguably we ALL like drama in our music. At least, we enjoy some
form of contrast and emotional storytelling. The deliberate use of consonance and dissonance in
composition creates moments of tension and release. As listeners, we experience that usually
as emotion. Music activates memory, provokes feelings and fuels thought.
</p>

<p>
As you can see, we've entered the role now of music critic! This has happened because
composers usually (I hope) write with intent. Critics feel (rightly or not) in a position
where they can evaluate how well music presses their buttons. A large part of this is due to
how well the music is functioning.
</p>

<p>
IN CONCLUSION
</p>

<p>
I hope this isn't too wooly an article to serve as over-view. The idea here is to show how function pervades
the writing, playing and appreciation of music. By thinking in terms of structure and the
action of harmony we're able to infer some rules and patterns for the effects of those
structures. Most of the topics here will be getting at least one of their own articles. Please
jump to anything that interests you for more in-depth information.
