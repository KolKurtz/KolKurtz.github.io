		CHORD ANATOMY 2 - SEVENS
		</div>



		<div id="postContent">
      <p>
        Last <a href="EN15_CHORDANATOMY1.html">article</a> we covered triads, chords composed of three notes. Chords don't end
        there. In the same way that we described triads as two stacked third intervals, seventh
        chords can be thought of as three stacked thirds. The loosest definition for a
        seventh chord then is a stack of the root, third, fifth and seventh from a given
        root tone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as with triads, we can find the seventh chords in a key by taking each note
        in a scale and taking the third and fifth above it. This time we just go a bit
        further and add the seventh too. In C major that gives us C-E-G-B. Continuing on
        throught the C major scale we get D-F-A-C etc.
      </p>
                <img src="../Media/Image/cmaj7chord.png" class="oneOffImage" alt="c major 7">
      <p>
        Similarly to triads, the third in the chord still dictates whether the chord is
        major, minor or diminished. When naming sevenths chords we keep that information.
        Below I have determined all the seventh chords in C major. We end up with four new
        types of chords, once again determined by the semitone spaces between the notes
        of our major scale.
      </p>
        <img src="../Media/Image/alldiaseven.png" class="oneOffImage" alt="interval fingering">
      <p>
        We can think of the seventh chords in three groups stemming from their triad versions.
        When we add a major third on top of a major triad, we get a "major 7" chord (C-E-G-B);
        these occur for chords built on the first and fourth notes of the major scale. You may see it
        written as MAJ7,M7 or with a triangle symbol (CMAJ7, CM7 etc). When we add a minor third to a major
        triad we get the <a>HUGELY</a> important "dominant 7" chord (G-B-D-F). This only occurs on note 5 of the
        major scale. You will see that notated in music as just "7" eg(G7).
      </p>
      <p>
        Adding a minor third on top of a minor triad creates a "minor 7th" chord, for example
        D-F-A-C. These occur for chords built on the 2nd, 3rd and 6th notes of the major
        scale. It is often notated as min7 or m7.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final type of seventh chord is built on the diminished triad which is itself
        two stacked minor thirds (B-D-F in the case of C major). Using the notes of the major
        scale, the next third to add is major. This creates what is known as a "half diminished 7th"
        chord e.g.(B-D-F-A). The reason it is called "half diminished" is that composers often modify the
        chord by adding a minor third instead of the major third that you would get from the key (Ab rather than A).
        This creates instead a "fully diminished 7th", often called just a "diminished 7th". Notation is a bit
        weird. Half diminished is either written as "min7b5" or a superscript circle with a line though it. Diminshed
        chords are represented as "dim7" or as a superscript circle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modification to form a new chord (as in fully diminished 7) is part of a much broader subject, <a>"chromatic
        alteration"</a>. We will get to that, but suffice it to say that there are two types of
        diminished seventh chord and the "fully diminished" is both more commonly encountered AND
        more useful.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's a lot to cover here in terms of practice. Five types of chord, each yielding
        a further three <a>inversions</a>. That's a lot of potential arpeggios and combinations.
        I found that they key to getting to know the seventh chords was to think about their mood.
        This isn't my invention but rather a common musician's approach. I'd encourage any reader
        to find their own identity for each seventh chord, to help navigate, recognise and apply them.
        Loosely I think of the major 7 as nostalgic, the minor 7 as enigmatic and the dominant as
        quirky, mischievous. What do they make you think and feel?
      </p>

      <p>
        OTHER 4 NOTE CHORDS
      <p>
      </p>
      There are other types of four note chords eg: 6 chords. They are going to get their
      own attention. You might also see other chords, especially on guitar, composed of 4
      different notes. This is often a result of taking extended chords, having 4 or more
      notes and then dropping some of them. This can be done without harming the effect or
      "function" of the chord. This too will be the subject of a later article here on Growl.
