			<p>"Just what the internet needs. Another guitar blog!"</p>
			<p> Dont think I haven't already thought it and don't worry that pretty head. There's method to my madness. Albert Einstein said "If you can't explain something simply then you don't understand it". Or maybe it was Chris Rock. Doesn't matter. The point is, by writing down what I know, I crystalise my knowledge. In the process I'll be generating diagrams, jam tracks, all manner of stuff. Who knows? Some of it you too, good reader, may find useful.</p>
			<p> Who the hell is kolkurtz?</p>
			<p>That would be me, or rather the name I self apply on the internet. I have been playing guitar since I was 15 years old. Before that time I tried playing other instruments but couldn't really sit still long enough to do anything with them. I sang in a church choir a lot of my young life. A thing that I believe has helped my music no end. Nowadays I am composing for guitar, piano and synth. I'm writing 2 piano sonatas and a guitar sonata at the moment so a lot of my writing time is for that.</p>
