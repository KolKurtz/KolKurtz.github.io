		UNCAGED - The CAGED system. Is it any good?
		</div>



		<div id="postContent">
			<p> A lot has been written on the subject of CAGED. Commenters often raise questions about its merits and demerits; whether it forces people into patterns etc. Myself, I treat it like every other piece of knowledge, use it as a stepping stone to a better knowledge and a better system for understanding. In many ways CAGED is the perfect example for how this can work.</p>
			<p>Before I start blathering, I would say that beginners and intermediate players have the most to gain from CAGED. Advanced players are likely to have either their own system or a more established classical system for thinking about the fretboard.
			</p>
			<p>So what is it?</p>
			<p>The CAGED system breaks the guitar fretboard down into manageable chunks. It does this using the first-position shapes of C chord, A chord, G chord, E... as the basis for each new chunk of fretboard along the neck. There are clear advantages here as one of the first things most players learn well are these chord shapes in first position. So here comes the key knowledge of this system.</p>
			<img src="../Media/Image/CAGED.png" class="oneOffImage" alt="CAGED chords">
			<p><b>
			1) We can take a chord shape and change its ROOT* note and produce the same TYPE** of chord from a different root note.
			</b></p>
			<p>*The root note is the lowest note in the chord and is the one that determines the name of the chord. Eg: the chord C when played in first position contains the notes C, E and G. It is a C major chord. If we pick up that C chord shape, move up the fretboard and put it down again with the original root note of C now at D we get a D major chord.</p>
			<img src="../Media/Image/mergeCD.png" class="oneOffImage" alt="CAGED chords">
			<p>**We get the same type of chord because chords are like templates. All they are is recipes that specify the distances between the notes that they are made of and the point from which he chord starts. So a major chord recipe says for example, the root note is C, the next note (E) is four semitones away and the next (G) is 3 semitones from that. If we do a bit of fretboard maths (SKIP IF YOU LIKE!) we can see that when we put down the root note, add 5 semitones to move up a string, down a fret to take a semitone away (that's 4 semitones from C, the note E!). Up one string from the G to add five semitones, subtract 2 semitones (that's two frets) and we have the note G!
			</p>
			<img src="../Media/Image/Cmaths.png" class="oneOffImage" alt="CAGED chords">
			<p><b> 2) We can select a different POSITION for the root note of a chord on the fretboard and it will always use one of the five chord shapes C,A,G,E or D to form a chord of the same type. These chords always appear in the same pattern.
			</b></p>
			<p>For example, if we take the E shape of A major and then we choose to move the root note A up to where it appears on the A string at the 12th fret then we get the A shape chord for A major. You can see the D and C shapes in between in grey.
			</p>
			<img src="../Media/Image/As.png" class="oneOffImage" alt="CAGED chords">

			<p>What can we do with this knowledge?</p>

			<p>a) Overlay the pentatonic scale on the chords. There are only two more notes in the pentatonic than there are in the chords themselves. CAGED forms an early framework for relating the pentatonic scale positions to one another. This can be a big boost for early improvisation efforts.</p>

			<p>b) Make yourself exercises based on CAGED. For example, play all of the root notes of a scale down the neck eg(all the C's), then play all the thirds(E). Tricky when thinking about it note by note but easier with a framework. This is powerful as it gets you thinking about entry notes for phrases. Instead of playing every lick or solo from the root notes in the same position, why not be able to quickly jump into a phrase that starts at the other end of the fretboard and from the 3rd or 5th!</p>

			<p>c) This is the one that I STILL do. CAGED can be used as a basis for practice plans. My personal practice regime rotates in order to keep my brain and my fingers familiar with the whole fretboard. Today I have done G shape chords, arpeggios and scales! Tomorrow will be E shape.</p>


			<p>d) Crazy runs! Ever wondered how a guitarist plays that amazing phrase that starts at one end of the neck and traverses the whole thing. In many cases all they are doing is reapplying the same set of notes in the different CAGED positions. If you are playing to impress, this can be a great starting point for writing.</p>

			<p>In conclusion</p>

			<p>For a beginner CAGED is pretty powerful. I remember feeling very locked into the first position when I first started playing. Understanding how to play your chords in other positions on the guitar allows you more options both for sound AND playability. By way of example, who doesn't prefer playing an A shape F major chord at the 8th fret of the A string, than a barre in first position.</p>

			<p>CAGED is more useful for beginners as eventually the pattern of where chords and scales fall on the fretboard will become clearer and clearer to a player, without falling back on systems like CAGED. As a player learns scales, begins to compose and improvise and change voicings for chords he builds an innate knowledge of "where things are". The power of CAGED though is as a waypoint between those first few chord shapes and an extensive view of fretboard organisation. It is too much of a leap to try and get there in one go, CAGED fills that gap. When I improvise or play chord solos now I'm not relying on CAGED, but understanding where scales and keys overlap certainly owes a debt to my early efforts with the system.</p>
