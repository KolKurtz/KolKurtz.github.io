		A MODEL FOR CHORD EXTENSION part 1
		</div>



		<div id="postContent">


			<p>Recently I have been thinking about chord extensions in the form of added tensions. By those I mean 9,11,13 in their flat and natural forms. I'd like to add them into my practice routine but unless I play through planned chord progressions I so far lack the mental agility to throw them in organically.</p>
			<p>I find as with almost everything, establishing some loose rules and a framework should reduce the mental work required. Not as a shortcut but just to break through the initial wall.</p>

			<h3>A quick chord primer</h3>
			<p>This article is concerned with chord extensions particularly where they apply to jazz. I sepcify that because these aren't hard rules and in fact will lean in the direction of the specific type of jazz that I prefer (which is cool and modal).</p>

			<p>A seventh chord is formed by stacking thirds. Three of them to be exact. All of the seventh chords are varying combinations of minor and major thirds. For example;</p>

			<p>A major third plus a minor third plus a minor third gives us a dominant 7.</p>

			<p>It is possible however to keep adding thirds. First forming a 9th (a 2nd but an octave higher), then an 11th, then a 13th. I know this gives us finally a seven note chord (1,3,5,7,9,11,13) but fear not. Not every chord needs a seven string guitar, neither are all of the possible results playable on a normally tuned guitar.</p>

			<h3>Which tensions go with which chords?</h3>

			Major 7th
			<ul class="indentList">
				<li>- Often add a natural 9 (but not with a root in the melody)</li>
				<li>- suspended 4th used instead of 11</li>
				<li>- #11 but not with a 5th in melody</li>
				<li>- 13 is often avoided due to dissonance</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			Minor 7th
			<ul class="indentList">
				<li>- 9th is common to form a minor 9 chord (when the 7 is included)</li>
				<li>- b9 is rarely added (minor 7 b9)</li>
				<li>- 13th is useable but impacts voice leading to the 5  chord if that follows*</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			Dominant 7th
			<ul class="indentList">
				<li>- 9ths are used where they can lead to root</li>
				<li>- 11ths are used where they can lead to 3;  11th chords MUST have a 7th</li>
				<li>- 13ths are used where they can lead to 5</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			<p>
				Next week I am going to try and make some diagrams with these rules as basis. This should allow us to form a mental framework for building extended chords on the fly! See you in part 2.
			</p>

			<br>
			*The included 13th weakens the voice leading in 2-5-1 progressions as it contains a tritone. This pre-empts the tension of the V chord reducing it's impact.
