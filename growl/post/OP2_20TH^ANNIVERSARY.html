		TO START AT THE BEGINNING
		</p>

		<p>
      Why did I first pick up a guitar? Well, I always sang a lot and played whatever was
  around to a lesser extent. I never took music lessons or studied music, but our house
  was a classical music house and I sang in the church choir. When I turned
  15 though I was firmly a fan of guitar based music. In particular Nirvana and the
  Smashing Pumpkins. I made friends who played and discovered that maybe musical instruments
  didn't have as high a barrier to entry as I had believed.
		</p>
    <p>
    I never chose music at school. I went for a maths/science route. I never believed that I
    had any aptitude for music. I'm not sure why. I could sing well, I memorised melody almost
    instantly. Studying music just never seemed to present any value for my future working life.
    That's maybe another subject. But suffice it to say, when I picked up a guitar I had no idea
    what I was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
    My friends taught me chords, starting with the Em/G of "About A Girl". From there it was all
    chords for a couple of years. As soon as I had four chords down I wrote a truly awful song of
    my own with them which I will NOT be sharing! There was no internet then so the majority of
    what I learned, I learned by ear. Who remembers how easy it was to rewind cassette tapes?
    My tastes as they were though I pretty quickly wanted to sound more like Jimmy Paige and Slash.
    That meant using TAB. My relationship with TAB started with buying my first TAB books. I still
    have Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness and Siamese Dream right next to me, both are a bit frayed.
		</p>
    <p>
    Things stayed like that for about 10 years! For the most part I played by ear, learned by ear and wrote
    by ear. I wrote (bad) songs constantly that entire time. I was in a couple of silly bands and then in
    2004 I joined a real band. One which recorded, wrote, practised and performed; even eventually getting signed for a time.
    Still, I had no idea what I was doing! I knew a LOT of chord shapes and the pentatonic scale patterns. That
    carried me for a long, long time. My band mates were much the same. Writing was hard for us together, I
    think most of us lacked the language and understanding for real song structures. But we jammed, and although
    tough, it worked.
		</p>
    <p>
    Following the end of the band and the respective members moving to different corners of the world, my playing
    got introverted. My writing was already becoming far more complex. Although songs were still me glueing together
    bunches of chords; those chords had many extensions and were often broken or arpeggiated. Also they were often inverted,
    even though I didn't know that! The internet was in full bloom and I was consuming tab very quickly. Radiohead released
    Paranoid Android. The chords (on TAB I purchased) blew my mind. In 2008 I happened across Miles Davis and Charles Mingus.
    The limitations of TAB were becoming clear. When I struggled over Rordriguez Concerto D'Aranjuez in TAB I knew something
    was up.
		</p>
    <p>
    All of this carried me to about 2012. I was 32 years old, hated my career choices and realised I
    only really ever cared about music. I restructured my life around it, ensuring I had the time to study.
    My musical tastes were still rock but jazz had become an obsession. It was a form of music where I often couldn't just
    press play and work it out. If I had the chords and blew pentatonics over it, it didn't sound right. I wasn't playing anything
    wrong, it just didn't sound "cool". I leaned heavily into Reddit for some advice on how to actually become a musician. I bought
    Laitz - The Complete Musician and I've been working through it slowly and persistently ever since. I found a Coursera course
    on jazz improvisation led by Gary Burton and I completed it fastidiously. I bought a 5 octave keyboard and started learning.
		</p>
    <p>
    It's 4 years later now and I'm really quite amazed with how much I've changed. It's strange to say
    but the guitar has to some extent become a casualty of my musical development. I have never been the most dexterous player
    but trying to play true polyphony on a guitar is deeply difficult for me. So now that I want to play chordal solos and self
    accompanied melody lines I have issues. I'm not giving up! However, a large part of my song-writing has taken me to the piano.
    When I write a song now I don't randomly play chords until they fit together (at least not every time!), I start with form.
    When I choose a chord, I don't play the pattern that I know, I create a voicing. I no longer write one part at a time for
    eventual use in a group - I compose a piece meant for one player in isolation containing multiple parts. My chords are voice led
    and written as functional progressions. The changes are endless.
		</p>
    <p>
    Most important of all, in 2012 I started teaching myself to read music. Here in 2016 I can sight read; albeit slowly.
    There are so many benefits to this I don't know where to begin. Not least, I am now able to access
    classical music, something I have loved my whole life but could never tackle. I also compose in standard notation as well as
    setting exercises, reading textbooks and workbooks using it. I don't like it much, I find it unwieldy, but what it can do for you
    more than makes up for it.
		</p>
    <p>
    So, that's how I got here. I guess the summary is that I clawed in the dark for years until it was impossible. I changed
    my life, got serious, got educated and transformed.
  </p>
    What were the major catalysts?
    <ul>
      <li>The growing complexity of my writing</li>
      <li>The inadequacy of my tools i.e. TAB</li>
      <li>My changing tastes - jazz in particular</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    What helped me the most?
    <ul>
      <li>Learning tonal harmony from college textbooks</li>
      <li>Learning to read music</li>
      <li>Using keyboards</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
